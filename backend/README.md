Submitted by: Fahad Al-Hadeethi (Student ID: 101432174)
Submission Date: October 13, 2024

This project is part of the COMP3123 Full Stack Development course. The assignment involves creating a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application performs user authentication (signup and login) and employee management (CRUD operations) using MongoDB as the database. The API is designed to follow the principles of RESTful architecture and includes routes for user management and employee management.

The key functionalities of the project include:

User Signup and Login
Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for employee data
Password hashing using bcrypt
Validation and proper error handling for API requests
This project was developed using:

Node.js and Express.js for backend development
MongoDB for database management
Mongoose for data modeling
Postman for testing the API
The objective of the assignment is to demonstrate the ability to design and implement a backend system that performs key operations, manage users and employee data, and handle database interactions securely.

Sample User List for Testing:
Below are the sample users that can be used for testing the login functionality of the API:

{
  "username": "FahadAlHadeethi",
  "email": "FahadAlHadeethi@example.com",
  "password": "pass22"
}
